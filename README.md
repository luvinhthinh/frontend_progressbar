Requirements:

·         Behaviours 

·         Multiple bars

·         One set of controls that can control each bar on the fly

·         Can't go under 0

·         Can go over 100, but limit the bar itself and change its colour

·         Display usage amount, centred

·         Write tests for your code (hint: TDD strongly preferred)

·         Implement a responsive solution: testing it on mobile, tablet, etc. Getting it working nicely.

·         Animate the bar change, make sure it works well when you tap buttons quickly.

·         Publish your code online somewhere: GitHub or something like plnkr.co, jsfiddle.net


Bonus points for implementing "production quality" code, using practices such as:

·         Setting it up as a project

·         Setting up some automated tools

·         Version control (git)

·         Linting, code quality, etc

·         JavaScript/CSS minification, packaging, etc

·         Using a CSS pre-processor like SASS/SCSS

·         Styling it to a production quality level
